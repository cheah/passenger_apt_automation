# When generating Nginx packages, this dictates the number that's at
# the very end of the package version numbers, right after the tilde (~).
# For example, in "nginx-full_1:1.6.0-2.4.0.42~trusty5", the "5" at the end
# is the hotfix version.
#
# You must bump this version every time you release updated Nginx
# packages for an Nginx and Phusion Passenger version that you had
# already released before. For example, if packages for Nginx 1.6.0 +
# Passenger 4.0.42 have already been released, and you discovered a
# bug in the Nginx packages, then bump this hotfix version and release
# new Nginx packages.
#
# But if either the Nginx version or the Passenger version has changed
# since last time, you should reset this number back to 1.
